# CST276SRS02  

Date Validation Strategy/Template Method  

Name: Easa El Sirgany

---
Issues:  All issues are also contained in source with the "TODO:" tag
	* All output information from polygons require the ability to JSONify Lines
		-- There is no support for JSONifying any Shapes as of yet


Notes:  All notes are also contained in source with the "NOTE:" tag
	* Requirements are not complete enough (for me)
		-- Need to know what a shape needs to be able to draw it (e.g. coordinates, etc.)
			= Assumptions were made revolving a coordinate system for basic functionality
		-- SRS states rectangles must be drawn first, but I'm not drawing anything
